# About this Project
This project involves creating a Docker image from a FastAPI application and deploying it on AWS cloud services. The infrastructure is built using Terraform, and continuous deployment is automated through GitHub actions. The Docker images are stored in an ECR public repository, and they are run on AWS ECS with EC2 instances. The EC2 instances are managed by an Application Load Balancer, which also handles auto-scaling.
