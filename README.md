# About this Project
It involves creating a docker image out of Python FastAPI Web framework application (main.py) and utilizing AWS cloud services to run and store images. The infrastructure was built through Terraform and Github action for automating continuous deployment, building and pushing the new docker image tags to ECR's public repository where all versions of the images are stored. The containers run on Elastic Container Service (ECS) using the EC2 launch type which is fronted by an Application load balancer with auto-scaling action for the EC2 container instances.
